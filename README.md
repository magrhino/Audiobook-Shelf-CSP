üõ°Ô∏è Working CSP Setup for Audiobookshelf Behind NPMplus (OpenResty)

Hey everyone,

Just wanted to share a working Content Security Policy (CSP) configuration I‚Äôve been using with NPMplus as a reverse proxy for Audiobookshelf.

This setup:
	‚Ä¢	Clears any CSP headers from upstream
	‚Ä¢	Applies a strict global policy
	‚Ä¢	Still allows the app (and its service worker) to function correctly

üîß Nginx/NPMplus Custom Configuration

```
# Global CSP (strict)
more_clear_headers 'Content-Security-Policy';
add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'none'; base-uri 'self'; frame-ancestors 'self'; form-action 'self'; manifest-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'wasm-unsafe-eval'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://fonts.googleapis.com; font-src 'self' https://fonts.gstatic.com; img-src 'self' data: blob: https://books.google.com https://m.media-amazon.com https://covers.openlibrary.org https://*.openlibrary.org https://archive.org https://*.archive.org https://*.mzstatic.com https://fantlab.ru https://*.fantlab.ru; connect-src 'self' wss: https://api.github.com/repos/advplyr/audiobookshelf/releases; media-src 'self' blob:; worker-src 'self' blob:; object-src 'none'; upgrade-insecure-requests" always;

# Relaxed CSP for any service worker file at root or in subfolders
location ~* ^/.*/?(sw|service-worker)\.js$ {
  more_clear_headers 'Content-Security-Policy';
  add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'none'; base-uri 'self'; frame-ancestors 'self'; form-action 'self'; manifest-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'wasm-unsafe-eval' https://cdn.jsdelivr.net; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://fonts.googleapis.com; font-src 'self' https://fonts.gstatic.com; img-src 'self' data: blob: https://books.google.com https://m.media-amazon.com https://covers.openlibrary.org https://*.openlibrary.org; connect-src 'self' wss: https://api.github.com/repos/advplyr/audiobookshelf/releases; media-src 'self' blob:; worker-src 'self' blob:; object-src 'none'; upgrade-insecure-requests" always;
}
```

‚úÖ What This Does
	‚Ä¢	Blocks everything by default:
default-src 'none'
	‚Ä¢	Whitelists only the domains Audiobookshelf actually uses:
	‚Ä¢	Google Books
	‚Ä¢	OpenLibrary
	‚Ä¢	Archive.org
	‚Ä¢	Apple cover images (mzstatic)
	‚Ä¢	Loosens CSP for the service worker to allow pulling Workbox from jsDelivr

‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitation
	‚Ä¢	Mozilla Observatory still flags the config due to 'unsafe-inline'.
Unfortunately, this is currently required since Audiobookshelf uses inline scripts and styles.
	‚Ä¢	I haven‚Äôt implemented nonce or hash support yet. If anyone gets nonces working cleanly with NPMplus, please share!

Hope this helps anyone looking to harden their Audiobookshelf instance behind NPMplus.
Feel free to open an issue or pull request if you improve upon this setup!

Once this is posted on GitHub, you can link to it directly in your Reddit post with something like:

I posted my full working NPMplus CSP config for Audiobookshelf on GitHub: [GitHub link here] ‚Äî hope it helps others!

Let me know if you want help writing the actual Nginx config or setting up the GitHub repo/page!
